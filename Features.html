      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>We use semantic HTML5 elements and ARIA attributes to make sure everyone can use our site easily.</p>
    <p> Accessibility is essential for creating websites that everyone can use, including people with disabilities. Use semantic HTML5 elements and proper ARIA attributes to define clear page landmarks and improve navigation for screen readers. Ensure your content has a logical heading structure, descriptive link text, and appropriate alternative text for images. By prioritizing accessibility, your site becomes more inclusive and user-friendly, while also meeting web standards and potentially improving your search engine visibility. </p>

      <h2>SEO</h2>
      <p>By structuring this content properly and using descriptive metadata, we help search engines understand and rank our pages better.</p>
   <p> For effective SEO, structure your page using heading tags (such as &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;h2&gt;, and &lt;h3&gt;) in the correct hierarchical order to help search engines understand the importance and relationship of your content sections. Use descriptive, keyword-rich text that accurately summarizes your topics without overstuffing. Ensure all content remains clear and easy to read for users while being well-organized for crawlers. Thoughtful use of metadata, meaningful links, and clean HTML markup will also boost discoverability and help your page rank higher in relevant search results. </p>
